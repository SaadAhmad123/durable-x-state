/**
 * Represents the configuration schema for an orchestration state machine, encompassing states, transitions,

 *
 * Attributes:
 * - `id`: A unique identifier for the orchestration machine, crucial for distinguishing between different machines.
 * - `description`: An optional detailed description of the orchestration machine's purpose and its functional scope.
 * - `context`: A function or static object that defines the initial state context, either generated statically or dynamically based on input data.
 * - `initial`: The initial state identifier the machine will enter upon instantiation, required unless the type is 'parallel'.
 * - `type`: The type of state machine, such as 'parallel', affecting how states are managed and executed.
 * - `states`: A mapping of state identifiers to their configurations, detailing behavior and structural relationships.
 *
 * @typeparam TContext Describes the type of the state context, encapsulating the structure and data within each state.
 * @typeparam TInput Defines the type of input data that influences or initializes the state context.

/**
 * Configures individual states within an orchestration machine, including details on state types, transitions,

 *
 * Attributes:
 * - `type`: Specifies the state's operational modeâ€”'parallel', 'final', or standard. Defines whether the state can run concurrently with others or is an endpoint.
 * - `description`: An optional detailed explanation of the state's purpose or behavior.
 * - `initial`: Identifier for the initial state within nested configurations, required for non-parallel types.
 * - `emit`: Configurations for emitting events upon state entry, facilitating reactive programming.
 * - `entry`: Actions to execute upon entering the state, which can modify the context or trigger side effects.
 * - `exit`: Actions to execute upon exiting the state, important for cleanup or final state adjustments.
 * - `on`: Event-driven transitions detailing responses to events within this state.
 * - `onDone`: Target state after completing all sub-states in a 'parallel' configuration.
 * - `states`: Definitions of nested states, supporting hierarchical state structures.
 * - `always`: An unconditional transition that triggers when the state is reached, ensuring smooth progressions.
 *
 * @typeparam TContext The context type of the state machine, defining the shape of data available during state transitions.
